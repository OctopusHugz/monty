# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

This project focuses on learning the fundamentals of stacks and queues by building a bytecode interpreter for the Monty language.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

## Data Structures
```
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO Holberton project
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_t;
```
```
/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO Holberton project
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;
```
## Compilation & Output
* Your code will be compiled this way:
```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
* Any output must be printed on stdout
* Any error message must be printed on stderr

## The monty program

* Usage: ```monty file```
* where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
* If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
* If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
* where <file> is the name of the file
* If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
* where is the line number where the instruction appears.
* Line numbers always start at 1
* The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
* it executed properly every line of the file
* it finds an error in the file
* an error occured
* If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
* You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
